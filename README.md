## 🚀 About Me

I'm **Lewiski**, a **Software Engineering student** with a lifelong passion for technology.  
My journey started back in **5th grade**, inspired by a Nickelodeon show called *“Game Shakers.”*  
They made creating games look fun and easy — and that moment sparked a dream that’s been driving me ever since.

Over the years, I’ve evolved from curiosity to craft — building websites, experimenting with new stacks, and launching my own SaaS.  
My project **[Save My Semester](https://studio--studio-7100783120-75122.us-central1.hosted.app/)** was born from my desire to help students learn smarter and manage their coursework better — an evolution of my earlier project, *MMU Genius*.

🎯 I’m passionate about:
- Building **useful digital tools** that make life easier
- Turning **ideas into scalable applications**
- Consistently **learning, growing, and sharing knowledge**
